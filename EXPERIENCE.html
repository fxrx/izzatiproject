<h1> VISIT PENANG HILL </h1>
<p>  HERE IS MY EXPERIENCE, LAST YEAR BEFORE PANDEMIC COVID-19 HIT OUR COUNTRY, I HAD THE OPPURTUNITY TO VISIT PENANG. I LOVE GO TO PENANG BECAUSE AT THERE HAVE THE BEAUTIFUL PLACES TO VISIT. THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE VISIT PENANG HILL, PENANG HILL LOCATED AT AN ALTITUDE 833M ABOVE GEORGETOWN AND HAS A COLD TEMPERATURE AND A BEAUTIFUL PANORAMA. THE RAILWAY IS KIND OF HIDDEN IN THE URBAN CHAOS OF EASTERN PENANG AND AS SUCH IS A BIT OF AN ADVENTURE TO GET TO. THE INTERESTING IN PENANG HILL IS I CAN GO ON NATURE WALK AT THE HABITAT OF PENANG HILL, FASTEN A LOVE LOCK, ENJOY SPECTACULAR VIEWS OF THE CITY,VISIT HISTORIAL BUILDINGS SUCH AS THE OWL MUSEUM, UNWIND AT THE HIGHEST CAFÃ‰ IN PENANG AND KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR RARE FLORA AND FAUNA. </p>
<p> AFTER THAT, I GO TO VISIT PADANG KOTA LAMA WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS THE PENANG ESPLANADE THAT LOCATED IN THE NORTH-EASTERN TIP OF GEORGETOWN, l LOVE TO GO THERE BECAUSE I LOVE EAT. AT THERE, THERE A LOT OF CHOICES OF FOOD SUCH AS NASI KANDAR, SEAFOOD AND PASEMBOR AND JERUK PAK ALI. I REALLY LOVE EAT PASEMBUR. SO, IF I WENT THERE I WOULD MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EAT PASEMBUR. </p>
